    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-static-truss-1_description =  Two JX-STAT 1x2s, welded together? Madness!
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-static-truss-2_description = As a follow-on to the well-regarded IX-STAT, the JX-STAT series could allow Probodobodyne to regain the lead in static solar panel technology.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x3-1_description = As a follow up to the underwhelmingly popular OX07 1x4, the OX05 1x3 also includes concentrator lenses and sacrifices its ability to retract. The result is a panel that is quite light for its generation capabilities. Just don't sneeze on it.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x3-2_description = The SP05 is a shrouded version of the OX05 panel that has the ability to retract into a tiny box.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x5-2_description = A bendier but larger version of the OX14, the KTS engineers have created this largish panel set for those power-hungry governments and spacecraft out there. Panel cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-25-1_description = Someday, we hope to be able to spray-paint an entire rocket stage with solar panels. For now, using glue and defunct IX-STATs, this is the best we can do.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-deploying-25-1_description = Strong and compact when undeployed, the NOL-series solar arrays sure look cool and are quite strong. Perhaps not the best choice for maximum solar efficiency, though.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-deploying-375-1_description = The NOL-B expands into a massive 10m footprint, providing modest power for a modest price and mass ratio.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-1_description = UKEB offers a new take on solar arrays - really, really big. Their first entry into the market simply dwarfs every other solar panel on the market. Due to its unique construction methods, the panel is relatively cheap and light, but can't match smaller panels in power density. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-2_description = UKEB's smallest blanket panel retains the lightness and low cost of their larger offering, but packages it into a more reasonable size. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-3_description = Using a novel circular deployment method appropriated from Kerbal Techsystems, UKEB has packaged a reasonably large blanket solar array into a small footprint. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-4_description = The fan-shaped UKEB-075 array does not actual act as a fan, and wiggling it back and forth in space does not provide any cooling. However, it is the only blanket array that can be retracted successfully

    // Batteries
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-rad-125_title = Z-800 Rechargeable Battery // B-800
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-0625_title = Z-k03 Rechargeable Battery Bank  // B-3K
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-0625_description = The biggest selling point of the Z-k03 is its reliance on 28 AAAA batteries, for redundancy. Note, unit may not operate with any dead batteries present. Do not attempt to remove batteries while running.

    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-125_title = Z-k06 Rechargeable Battery Bank  // // B-6K
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-125_description = The Z-k06 is generally more reliable than the Z-k03, because it uses the less accident-prone E batteries in its inline mount. Batt-Direct also advertises replacement capability for each battery, but recommends that this not be done by anyone outside of Batt-Direct. And certainly not in space.

    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-25_title = Z-k12 Rechargeable Battery Bank  // B-12K
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-375_title = Z-k10 Rechargeable Battery Bank // B-10K
    #LOC_NFElectrical_battery-375_description = It's likely that without the impetus for extra-large parts that Kerbodyne provided, the Z-k10 would have remained a far-off dream in Bandas Kerman's mind. An innovative system of removable wedge-shaped battery platters deliver quite a large amount of charge.

    // Capacitors
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-0625_title = ZP-1.6K Capacitor Bank  // CAR-1.6K Capacitor Bank
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-125_title = ZP-8K Capacitor Bank  // CAR-8K Capacitor Bank
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-125_description = By mounting six enhanced ZP-102s on a central mount, a decently sized inline capacitor bank can be created. Additionally, it can easily blow out all of the lights at the KSC!

    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-25_title = ZP-EXTRA Capacitor Bank   // CAR-EXTRA Capacitor Bank
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-radial-0625_title = ZP-101 Capacitor  // CAP-101 Capacitor
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-radial-0625_description =  The ZP-101 is a radially attachable discharge capacitor. Through slow to charge up, when triggered, it will rapidly deposit its stored charge into your Electric Charge banks.

    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-radial-0625-2_title = ZP-106 Capacitor  // CAP-106 Capacitor
    #LOC_NFElectrical_capacitor-radial-0625-2_description =The ZP-106 is a more powerful radial capacitor using three of those new ZP-3A units. They're slightly flattened due to being stacked under a few boxes of Mainsails.

    // Generator
    #LOC_NFElectrical_rtg-0625_title = U-NUK-AS Radioisotope Generator // PB-AS-NUK
    #LOC_NFElectrical_rtg-0625_description = Using a larger amount of Blutonium-238 than the U-NUK and a more efficient energy conversion system based on technology reverse engineered from a Post-Kerbin generator, engineers at Ionic Symphonic have perfected this advanced RTG for expensive but continuous power.  // PB-NUK
    // Reactors
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-0625_title = UX-0 'KerboPower' Fission Generator // MX-0
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-125_title = UX-1 'GARNET' Fission Reactor        // MX-1
        #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-125_description = The UX-1 is a compact fission reactor that produces up to 400 kW of electric power. Be sure to attach enough heat radiation capacity to run it!
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-25_title = UX-2S 'Prometheus' Fission Reactor    // MX-2S
        #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-25_description = The UX-2S is a workhorse fission reactor that produces a shocking 2 MW of electric power. Exceptional nowhere, but a step on the road to greatness.
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-25-2_title =  UX-2T 'Excalibur' Fission Reactor  // MX-2L
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-25-2_description = The UX-2T is the second-largest fission reactor available through sheer footprint. Not only does it produce more power than its cousin the UX-2S, it does so at a higher efficiency and so requires less additional radiator mass.
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-375_title = UX-3S F.L.A.T. Fission Reactor
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-375_description = The success of the advanced generators in the UX-2T has allowed the manufacturers to refurbish old UX-2S cores and ship them again with an improved power generation section. The F.L.A.T. is the one of the most fuel efficient and reliable reactors ever built, and combines this with an extra generous loading of nuclear fuel to achieve unprecedented core lifetime.
    #LOC_NFElectrical_reactor-375-2_title = UX-3T 'Hermes' Fission Reactor  // MX-3L
