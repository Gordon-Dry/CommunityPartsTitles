    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-static-truss-1_description =  Two JX-STAT 1x2s, welded together? Madness!
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-static-truss-2_description = As a follow-on to the well-regarded IX-STAT, the JX-STAT series could allow Probodobodyne to regain the lead in static solar panel technology.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x3-1_description = As a follow up to the underwhelmingly popular OX07 1x4, the OX05 1x3 also includes concentrator lenses and sacrifices its ability to retract. The result is a panel that is quite light for its generation capabilities. Just don't sneeze on it.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x3-2_description = The SP05 is a shrouded version of the OX05 panel that has the ability to retract into a tiny box.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-deploying-1x5-2_description = A bendier but larger version of the OX14, the KTS engineers have created this largish panel set for those power-hungry governments and spacecraft out there. Panel cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-25-1_description = Someday, we hope to be able to spray-paint an entire rocket stage with solar panels. For now, using glue and defunct IX-STATs, this is the best we can do.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-deploying-25-1_description = Strong and compact when undeployed, the NOL-series solar arrays sure look cool and are quite strong. Perhaps not the best choice for maximum solar efficiency, though.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-curved-deploying-375-1_description = The NOL-B expands into a massive 10m footprint, providing modest power for a modest price and mass ratio.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-1_description = UKEB offers a new take on solar arrays - really, really big. Their first entry into the market simply dwarfs every other solar panel on the market. Due to its unique construction methods, the panel is relatively cheap and light, but can't match smaller panels in power density. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-2_description = UKEB's smallest blanket panel retains the lightness and low cost of their larger offering, but packages it into a more reasonable size. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-3_description = Using a novel circular deployment method appropriated from Kerbal Techsystems, UKEB has packaged a reasonably large blanket solar array into a small footprint. Cannot be retracted.
    #LOC_NFSolar_solarpanel-blanket-4_description = The fan-shaped UKEB-075 array does not actual act as a fan, and wiggling it back and forth in space does not provide any cooling. However, it is the only blanket array that can be retracted successfully
